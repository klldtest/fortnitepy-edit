Commands Framework
====================================================

This is the documentation for the bot commands framework ported from `discord.py <https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/>`_. If you ever need help, please do not
ask the discord.py community. They're not maintainers of this ported version and all questions should be asked either in an issue or in the discord support server linked
in fortnitepy's readme.
